# dose
A pure-JS webapp to ration your candy out after halloween (if a bit late)

## features
- Use a balanced mode to spread out by rating or random mode to get pure chaos
- Pick an end date for when you get more candy
- Jupscare
- Runs on most things (I kinda gave up on mobile)

## usage
- Add your candies and how many you got. You can split them up, like "1/4th full size kitkat" if you like - whatever name you want.
- Pick ratings for them so worse ones are prioritized to be combined.
- Pick Balanced or Random mode (you probably want Balanced...?)
- hit Go!
- dont get jupscared
